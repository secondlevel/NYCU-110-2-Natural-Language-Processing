# NYCU-110-2-Natural-Language-Processing

This project is to recognize emotion through corpus, which is related to [**kaggle competition**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nycu-nlp110/overview). All the models in this project were built by [**HuggingFace**](https://huggingface.co/). HuggingFace toolkit is developed by Pytorch.

In addition, please refer to the following report link for detailed report and description of the experimental results.
