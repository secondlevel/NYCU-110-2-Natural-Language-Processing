I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don not respond to or even acknowledge emails. Well_comma_ sometimes people are busy and don not have the time to check emails.

I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other. Isn not that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?. I am not so sure.

I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!. Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer.

"I will always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago_comma_ and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I have loved baby belugas since ;-).

At least you will get to graduate sooner. Yes_comma_ exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance_comma_ two days ago he claimed that a local church used their  personal fire department  (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church tax exemptions. Ludicrous!. That is the craziest thing I have ever heard. ,4
Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been. That is awesome. What are you going to do about it?. Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!. I am envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?. ,4
My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness. oh i know friends like those. I wish they did not suffer_comma_ because it is my suffering. i believe you. Thanks for your comprehension. ,5
Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window. Oh wow_comma_ sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?. By the time we noticed how bad it was_comma_ we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed. Did you have any damage to your home?. ,4
I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely. That is really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?. No unfortunately there isn not.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn not guaranteed. I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?. no it is an autoimmune disease. ,5
Hi_comma_ I am separated_comma_ I am hurt and my heart is broken. When did you get separated? By the way_comma_ that is terrible to hear. one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Why are you so down_comma_ my depressed friend?. is that he loved her. ,5
This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn not find where it was coming from. Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?. Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky. Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn not grow mold!. ,4
I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly_comma_ though_comma_ and things have not been the same since. I hate to hear that_comma_ what happened that made it end poorly?. We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together. maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other. ,4
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I will explode! I get that she has to go to work_comma_ but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!. I know the feeling. You too_comma_ huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn not be right. Leave a note on their door. and at the end put ""thanks in advance"" lol. Nice idea_comma_ but I don not think subtlety is their strong point - they would be liable to make even more noise_comma_ lol. Well_comma_ you can at least try. . I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!. You could get earplugs lol. ",8
I am seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he will tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes_comma_ but the suspense is killing me!. Oh man! What happened to your hip?. I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!. Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?. From what I have read_comma_ unless it is a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon will just lawyer up. What happened to you?. If it is medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks_comma_ it is only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won not be charged if you don not win. It is pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me.. Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won not bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn not do it to someone else. Thank you! I hear you..I didn not want to do it at first...but it is worth it for her..It is a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it_comma_ botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!. ,8
The weather here feels kinda mild today_comma_ I am shocked that it is only in the 80s in August. Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?. I am. It is not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done. Nice! Mowing the lawn isn not fun in the heat unless you are using a super fast one of course. ,4
Writing speeches makes me nervous. I agree_comma_ the writing part is easy part_comma_ but the speaking part is the worst!. Yeah_comma_ it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience. Maybe so_comma_ they say to imagine the crowd naked_comma_ but I don not think that helps too much with the writing part. True_comma_ a lot of people don not even have to think about what they are gonna say. ,5
I don not watch a lot of kids movies these days_comma_ but they always bring back fond memories. Same. What are your favorites?. I have seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times_comma_ that and Harry Potter!. That is funny. I have also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!. Yeah_comma_ sometimes there is more to those movies than you think_comma_ like they actually considered how adults would react. I have noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them. Yeah_comma_ maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything. Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier. ,8
Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life. Yeah I get that. Where did you work?. Dairy Queen_comma_ it was the only restaurant in my town. Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!. True_comma_ most of my friends worked there too so it wasn not too boring. Yes _comma_ work is better with friends. Yeah_comma_ so there wasn not too much of a pressure to work really hard_comma_ it wasn not too busy either. Really? I am surprised the only restaurant in town wasn not busy. ,8
Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day. Did you see that happen today?. Yeah_comma_ someone paid for this guy groceries in the store without asking!. That is pretty cool.  What a nice person. Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing. ,5
Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking. Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?. I found a bike on the side of the road but didn not test it before coasting down this hill. That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?. Yeah_comma_ usually I don not trust myself with those kinds of things_comma_ but I decided to go for it_comma_ rolled on some grass to lose a little speed. ,5
When you are in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks. Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?. Yeah_comma_ I am not good with confrontations. Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation. I don not think I have ever regretted not saying anything_comma_ but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong. ,5
I found out yesterday at work that I am one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good_comma_ I didn not know I was doing *that* well!. That is great. Usually at the end of the day it is never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!. Congrats. I want a promotion at my job. How long have you been there?. three years. I am sure you have done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?. I think I am just going to move on. ,8
My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!. Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?. Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries_comma_ but the rest - I should save it_comma_ my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive. That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead. If I had dispensible funds like that_comma_ there would definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it_comma_ but alas_comma_ priorites.  *lol*. ,5
I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!. Cool. Does that get a bonus?. I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That is a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*. That is awesome. . I am just happy to be recognized_comma_ especially since most times I just see myself as a  cog in the wheel . Well now you know you are pretty great at your job. I just do the best I can - that is all anyone really expects. ,7
"So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today. Was he upset?. He kinda gave me the ""Mom_comma_ really?"" look but I told him that we would ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*. I hate when that happens. . I do_comma_ too.  I tend to get  mom brain  at the worst times!  I will be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he is 10 now]. I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions. It is easier with a list but still_comma_ you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD. You are so right. ",8
I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store. Did you go back?. No_comma_ I didn not.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him_comma_ I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store. Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it. Multiple bags of chips_comma_ to be sure!  *chuckle*  . Or you can get a variety pack!. Those are a lifesaver - he is in Scouts and he is starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!. ,7
My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month. That is nice. I could get that here. I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she is related to me.  So I didn not think she would be as cool about it as she was. Well now you know. Yeah_comma_ I think that is where the anxiety was - the not knowing. ,5
I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!. Noice!  What was it about?. I had to explain global warming to my son Boy Scout troop. Very cool_comma_ are you a scientist?. Nope_comma_ just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me. ,5
I broke up with my boyfriend last week. Oh no! That is awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn not good for you.  How are you feeling?. Well_comma_ I am hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we have not been together and outside of being online_comma_ the quiet is kinda loud. I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again. Yeah.  It is a positive that we broke up_comma_ I am just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that is left. ,5
I found out that I am getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!. Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?.

After feeling like a cog in the wheel_comma_ it is nice that someone noticed my hard work!. ,5
I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!. I wish I could relate. I am a male_comma_ so I will never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It is such an impressive thing to go through_comma_ and no matter what_comma_ mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?. 15 and 19! It hasn not always been blissful_comma_ as any relationship journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you will be a dad...?. Yeah_comma_ I will consider it.

My brothers have had 5 kids between them_comma_ so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime_comma_ and they have given me lots of practice_comma_ but I am grateful for that. 15 and 19_comma_ that is awesome. You are almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier. Ah_comma_ make the most of your nieces + nephews!

Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate. ,5
"I have felt so incredibly sad whenever we have had to say goodbye to any of our dogs. Wait_comma_ were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.

That sounds like a really relaxing time_comma_ I am jealous. ,4

I hope that you win your money back and then some_comma_ you really deserve it after all of that upset!. ,4
I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon. Lovely.  What did you do together?.

I wish your family can make it through these hard times :(. My parents health has deteriorated rapidly_comma_ and they refuse to go get counseling. It is very sad for me to see. If my sister died to breast cancer_comma_ I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :(. It is why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own. ,5
I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can not always get what you want. Amen to that.Life is so unfair it is not even funny. Life is not fair_comma_ but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with. Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that. ,4

There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn not happen to you too much in the future!! :). ,4
I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive. I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?. I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of. That sucks_comma_ I hope you get it figured out!. ,4
Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn not get an emergency packet together. So that is what I did - cash_comma_ water_comma_ important documents_comma_ a change of clothing. wow_comma_ it must have been quite an experience.

The other day I had a flat_comma_ but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes. 10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire.

I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary. That is terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises. Especially when it is based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact. I don not understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!. ,4
I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things. oh_comma_ that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?. Honestly_comma_ I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me. Better living through chemistry! I am glad you made it through. ,4

I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn. Ouch_comma_ I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there. Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck. Hmm_comma_ wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!. Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!. ,5
So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700. Ut oh.. what happened?.

I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act.

Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won not happen again!.

I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags.

The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn not disappoint_comma_ he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!. What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day. It is one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I am sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier. . Are you goings going to stay friends?. ,4

My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I am pleased for him but envy a little luck. That is amazing and a very quick profit!  I am a little bit jealous myself.  . Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!. It is amazing the effect something so seemingly small_comma_ like the company headquarters opening_comma_ can effect an entire town like that. ,4
So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it. Yikes.  Did you get injured?. No_comma_ but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny. Yeah and the lanes are really slick.

That is fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up. ,4
I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited. That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal. Thank you! I didn not feel like I would ever be able to do it_comma_ but consistency does seem to pay off. It is really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it. ,4
I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I am already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months. That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?. I have but I have never really stuck to it. This time is different though_comma_ I have been going for a few months and feeling great about the future.

Ok_comma_ so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I would had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn not have done that!. oh no what happened?. Well_comma_ they were shouting and stomping around_comma_ so I lost it! This morning_comma_ they have been quiet as church mice_comma_ so I guess it worked :). that would really help if it was a permanent solution. Yeah_comma_ I really do feel bad_comma_ but it is been going on for over a year. yeah enough is enough. i totally can not say i blame you. Perhaps I will try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up_comma_ lol. bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep. ,8
I was watching my dad house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone. I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid. No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn not touched it. That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on. ,4
I didn not see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I am finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN T wait!!. That will be an amazing trip!!. I know! And they have never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him.

I can not help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time. Christmas was always a nightmare for me. I am sorry. That makes me really sad.

Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn not sleep_comma_ walking her dog!. Oh_comma_that was so hillarious. It is now. But it sure wasn not at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!. ",5

I will try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don not wanna get obese. It is good that you are being more proactive about your health now. ,4
My co-worker just bought a brand new car. . Man_comma_ i wish i could get one. I know_comma_ me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I have been driving for 10 years. I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well. ,4
i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i am so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are. Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. . I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone. It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe. ,4
I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can not wait. It will be quiet as it looks onto a forest!. Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!. Not with traffic_comma_ but with the people upstairs - they are a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there_comma_ so fingers crossed!. OH that will be such a huge relief I am sure!  It is crazy that people behave that way_comma_ knowing they are causing other people such strife.

I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!. I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?. Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls.

I am glad you were able to visit him!. Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!. ,5
When I spend time with my family_comma_ it reminds me how lucky I really am. Aww. It is the things money can not buy that bring us the greatest joy_comma_ no?. Definitely.

I always say i am not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i am so ahsamed of it. I do the same! I think everyone does. yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad. I think it is a normal human activity. You don not need to feel bad. ,4

Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It is a restaurant and a store?. Yes_comma_ it is both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans_comma_ which are delicious!. Dragon tongue beans! I have never heard of them! What do they look like?. They are the same shape as regular green beans_comma_ but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans. I will have to look for those.

So you get some strange_comma_ different things to try!. It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?. ,8

When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life_comma_ I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people_comma_ yet was miserable in his own life. I think we never really know what is going on inside people mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life_comma_ but in reality_comma_ they are suffering. It is awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!. I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates. Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve. All around_comma_ it would be a good decision for society. Just last night_comma_ I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed_comma_ he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food. There is so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it is disgusting. ,7
I hadn not been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away. Oh no. I am so sorry. Can you video chat with her?.

I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel_comma_ I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport history!. Wow! That is insane_comma_ too bad you didn not bet with those kind of odds. Yeah_comma_ for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what fun rather than what you were aiming to do_comma_ if you get me.

In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times. That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations.

My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her. . That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That is kind of why I am not wild about cats_comma_ is because they are so independent_comma_ and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people. I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad. Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I am so sorry.. I hope you are not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over. ,4
I love to play golf_comma_ but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again. My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport_comma_ albeit a little expensive.

Well at night it is kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it_comma_ and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props.
