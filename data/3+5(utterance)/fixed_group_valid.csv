"A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had ""call ahead seating"" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later_comma_ our table was not ready!. That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can not guarantee 10 minutes. That is what I told the hostess.

being alive is so much stress and anxiety_comma_ why does it have to be like this? why can not we just all express our individual selves_comma_ instead we are forced to work so that we can eat . It is not fair_comma_ eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it is comforting know that most everyone feels the same? . Yes_comma_ it is true we all know this inside out_comma_ but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives_comma_ the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting_comma_ if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life_comma_ not one which just gives the impression of freedom_comma_ that is all there is now_comma_ faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings.

I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me. what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy law . May be you are right. But sometimes_comma_ you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy law may not work in every situation. ,4
My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week. Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? . She is getting much better.

Not necessarily_comma_  while it is true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell_comma_ scaring people into not being themselves_comma_ but death isn not a scary phase_comma_ and i don not care about whether i am going to die_comma_ as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive_comma_ i have passed that point_comma_ but after looking clearly you will see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact_comma_ science tells us this too_comma_ it is not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death_comma_ it is about growing . ,11
